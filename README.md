# Delegate-CPP

Delegates from C# are now in C++!!

This little project was made mostly for fun and aducational purposes.

Check examples to see the usage. For now it allows to use:

* Global functions
* Static functions
* Lambdas
* Functors
* The result of `std::bind`
* Member functions ~~(lame)~~
